Git has three main areas:

Working Directory: This is the directory on your local machine where you modify and create files.

Staging Area (Index): The staging area is an intermediate area where you select and stage the changes you want to include in the next commit. You can think of it as a holding area for changes you want to commit.

Repository: The repository is where Git stores the complete history of your project, including all the committed changes. It is usually located in the hidden .git folder within your project directory.
